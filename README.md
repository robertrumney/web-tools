# Web Tools for Unity SQL Database Communication

This repository contains a collection of web tools for facilitating communication between a Unity C# application and a SQL database. These tools enable storing, retrieving, and manipulating data within the database. Here's an overview of the elements included in this repository:

## SQL Database

The SQL folder contains the necessary SQL scripts to create and manage the database tables. It includes the table schema and any necessary indexes or constraints. You can import the SQL script into your SQL database management tool to set up the required database structure.

## C# Data Communication

The C# folder contains C# scripts that handle the communication between the Unity application and the SQL database. These scripts include functionality to send and receive data to and from the database. They utilize libraries such as ADO.NET or Entity Framework to establish connections, execute SQL queries, and retrieve or update data.

## PHP API

The PHP folder contains PHP scripts that serve as an intermediary between the Unity C# application and the SQL database. These scripts provide an API for communication, receiving requests from the Unity application, and performing the necessary database operations. The PHP scripts handle tasks such as user authentication, executing SQL queries, and returning data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON).

## Usage

To utilize these web tools for Unity SQL database communication, follow these general steps:

1. Set up the SQL database by importing the provided SQL script into your database management tool.

2. Configure the C# scripts to establish the connection with the SQL database. Update the connection details, query statements, and data retrieval or update logic as per your specific requirements.

3. Deploy the PHP scripts to a web server that supports PHP. Configure the necessary server settings and update the PHP scripts with the appropriate database connection details.

4. Integrate the C# scripts into your Unity application, ensuring they are appropriately called at the required points in your application's logic.
